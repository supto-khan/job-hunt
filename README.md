# Job Scraper + Daily Outreach System

An automated job discovery and cold outreach system built for software engineers. Finds fresh jobs daily, scores them against a **configurable role profile**, generates personalized LinkedIn outreach templates, and emails a curated list every morning.

**Target user:** Any developer running a job search — comes with presets for **Backend Python (3+ YOE)**, **Frontend React**, and **Fresher**. Swap profiles to retarget the entire pipeline (search queries, scoring weights, outreach copy) without editing code.

## What It Does

```
Every day at 10:00 AM BST (automatic):

  1. Collects jobs from 4 sources + 150 company career pages
  2. Scores each job against the ACTIVE profile (title/tech/exp/signals)
  3. Drops anything below the profile's min-score, deduplicates,
     cleans up jobs not seen in 14 days
  4. For top 15 jobs:
       - Generates LinkedIn people-search URLs per company
         (titles configured on the profile — Eng Manager, Tech Lead,
         CTO, CEO, HR, etc.)
       - Writes a personalized DM using the profile's templates
  5. Emails the curated list to the recipient configured on the profile
```

**Result:** Candidate opens email, gets 15 fresh matching jobs with ready-to-send LinkedIn DMs. Takes ~20 min/day to work through. Change roles? Switch profile — no code changes.

## Profiles

The pipeline is driven by an **active profile** — a single config blob that controls search queries, scoring, location preferences, and outreach copy. Switching profiles re-targets the system end-to-end without touching code.

### Built-in presets

Stored as YAML in `profiles/`. Import any of them from the Profile page (or via `POST /api/profiles/import`):

| Preset (`profiles/*.yaml`) | Who it's for |
|---|---|
| `backend_python.yaml` | Python/Django/FastAPI backend, 3+ YOE (the original target) |
| `frontend_react.yaml` | React/TypeScript frontend roles |
| `fresher_any.yaml` | Entry-level / 0-1 YOE across any stack |

### What a profile controls

A profile is one row in the `profiles` table (JSON config), with sections matching the **Profile page tabs**:

- **Search** — default search terms, positive/negative title keywords, relevant tech list, JSearch queries (country, posted-window, remote-only)
- **Scoring** — experience target (`fresher` / `junior` / `mid` / `senior` / `any`), min-score-to-show, min-score-to-store, weights for title/tech/experience/signals (sum to 100), core tech, domain signals
- **Location** — India-positive / India-negative keywords, timezone-compatible / incompatible lists
- **Outreach** — candidate name, bio, achievements, core/extra tech, short + long DM templates, LinkedIn search titles, email greeting, sender + recipient email, digest subject role word

### UI — `/profile` page

- Sidebar lists all saved profiles and shows the currently-active one
- Import any YAML preset, edit it, then **Save** or **Save & Activate**
- **Re-score All Jobs** — recomputes every stored job's relevance against the active profile (optionally drops anything that now falls below min-score-to-store)
- **Export YAML** — download the active profile as YAML (round-trips back into `profiles/`)
- **Duplicate / Delete** — fork a profile to tweak, or remove an unused one (the active profile can't be deleted — activate another first)

### Per-profile email settings

Email digest fields living on the profile: `recipient_email`, `email_greeting`, `email_digest_subject_role`. `recipient_email` **overrides** `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` in `.env`, so different profiles can send to different inboxes.

The **sender address is fixed to `SENDER_EMAIL` in `.env`** and is not a profile setting — it has to match `SENDER_APP_PASSWORD`. The Profile page shows it read-only; change it in `.env`.

### Profile API (summary)

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/profiles` | List all profiles + presets available for import |
| `GET /api/profiles/active` | Get the currently-active profile's full config |
| `GET /api/profiles/{id}` | Get one profile by id |
| `POST /api/profiles` | Create a new profile from a JSON body |
| `PUT /api/profiles/{id}` | Update name / description / config |
| `POST /api/profiles/{id}/activate` | Make this profile active (cache invalidated immediately) |
| `POST /api/profiles/{id}/duplicate` | Fork an existing profile |
| `DELETE /api/profiles/{id}` | Delete (rejected if active) |
| `POST /api/profiles/import` | Import a YAML preset by slug; optional `activate` + `overwrite` flags |
| `GET /api/profiles/{id}/export` | Export profile back to YAML |
| `POST /api/profiles/rescore-all` | Re-score every stored job against the active profile (`delete_below_min=true` to prune) |

On first run, if no profile exists, the system seeds a `Backend Python (legacy)` profile from the pre-profile hardcoded settings and activates it — so existing installs keep working.
